I've decided to start a personal blog about some of the random stuff I encounter
and do with technology (and possibly other things). There are a few reasons that
I've just now decided to make this.

## I owe a great deal of my knowledge to blogs

Thanks to others willing to share their ideas with the world, I've been able to
gain a wide array of knowledge and experience. I can't begin the count the
number of times when I've run into a problem or wanted to learn to do something
and a blog post had the answer. I want to pass on the knowledge I have to others
that might be searching for it.

## I want to become a better writer

It can be hard to get the right words out. Most of the writing I do on a daily
basis is either for school or short, casual messages. I'd like to have more
practice writing ideas in longer posts to a public audience.

## It looks good on a résumé

In the software industry it's important to be able to show off what you know and
have done. A list of classes or GPA alone won't get you hired. Having a GitHub
portfolio and technical blog can show your experience. I hope that this will be
a place I can showcase the things that I'm doing and learning.

Finally, and possibly most importantly:

## It's slightly more productive than spending hours on Reddit
