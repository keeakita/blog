One of the purposes I hoped this blog would eventually serve is to showcase some
of the projects that I've been working on. Unfortunately I haven't had time to
update it nearly as much as I'd like, but recently I've been working on
something that I'm extremely excited about, and the code is *almost* ready to be
pushed to production, pending some work to make sure the Internet doesn't
overwhelm the server.

With that being said...

Throughout history, humans have had a fundamental struggle with the forces of
nature. Battling for comfort has been a human conflict for trillions[^1] of
years, but only in the past few have innovators dared to dream big enough to
overcome the forces of earth, wind, and fire[^2]. Technologies that control the
quality of our air---from temperature to particulates---have been fundamental
building blocks of the indoor human experience. But even with the advent of the
so-called "cloud"[^3], these systems remain unconnected. At great personal
effort to ourselves, we must stand up to adjust the thermostat, turn up the
heater, or even to add a little moisture to the air. Why should we, as powerful
masters of our environment, suffer from having to physically move ourselves or
come home to unpleasant air that we have to wait for the system to correct?

No more. Moist is a innovative solution to the problem of uncomfortable, dry
air that plagues us all. Constructed from the [finest base materials](https://www.amazon.com/Homedics-Personal-Ultrasonic-Humidifier-White/dp/B005JSD2EE/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1473528502&sr=8-6&keywords=homedics+humidifier)
and ingenuity, Moist is a humidifier for the modern age. Moist provides a web
interface and API that can be used to turn a humidifier on and off remotely, as
well as monitor it's status. Designed in a lab[^4] with careful precision[^5],
Moist is set to change how we experience the air around us.

If The Cloud and Internet of Things weren't trendy enough to grab your
attention, then then the following will blow your mind: Moist is entirely open
source. We[^6] are so confident in this innovation and its brand power that
we're giving away all the details on how it was built, for free, to the public.
Not only that, but we are so sold on this "opening the sources" movement that
the web interface will be open for absolutely everyone to control (link coming
soon)!

There will be several more blog posts following this one that document the
hardware setup, interface server, and control server. Stay tuned for these
posts!
